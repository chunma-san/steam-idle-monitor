![Steam Idle Monitor: animated project banner](assets/banner.svg)

# Steam Idle Monitor

A small report generator that estimates idle and farming intervals from ArchiSteamFarm container logs.

**Runtime:** Python 3.11+ · **Configuration:** environment variables · **Deployment:** self-hosted

## Quick start

The supported deployment target is Linux. Create an isolated Python environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
# This script uses the Python standard library.
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env first. Use shell-compatible quoting for JSON and values with spaces.
set -a
. ./.env
set +a
python monitor.py
```

Only source a configuration file you created and trust. Starting the application can connect to external services; configure credentials and destinations first.

## Usage

Set ASF_CONTAINER to your ASF container name, then run the script. It reads up to 720 hours of available Docker logs and prints a report. Retention, log format changes and missing events affect the estimates.

## Configuration

`.env.example` contains placeholders only. Real credentials, IDs, storage locations and account settings belong in your private local configuration.

| Variable | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `ASF_CONTAINER` | Name of the ASF Docker container to inspect. |

## How it works and operational notes

Requires Docker CLI access. It does not log into Steam, sell cards or modify your inventory. ArchiSteamFarm is an independent upstream project.

## Project layout

- Source files implement the application and integrations.
- `requirements.txt` or the project file declares dependencies.
- `.env.example` documents configuration names without live values.
- `.gitignore` excludes credentials, sessions, generated data and build output.
- `assets/banner.svg` is an original animated vector illustration. It has a static fallback and respects reduced-motion preferences in supporting viewers.

## Verification

See [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) for the checks performed on this publication snapshot and the remaining deployment checks. A source check is not an end-to-end test of Discord, Telegram, music sites or your host.

## Privacy and upstream services

This repository is a configurable source distribution. It does not include a production database, personal saved-link collection, message archive, credentials, media library or existing Git history. Review local changes before committing them.

Third-party APIs, libraries and products remain the work of their respective maintainers. Review their terms and licenses before redistribution or deployment. The original project artwork is stored locally; it does not depend on a remote GIF or tracking service.
